# Smishing Detection using Machine Learning

Previous research has focused on spam/ham detection for SMS, but I want to narrow my research down to ham/phish in SMS, as there is a slight nuiance with spam and phishing based texts.

## Datasets

I will be using publically available datasets that have labelled data for ham/spam/phish.
